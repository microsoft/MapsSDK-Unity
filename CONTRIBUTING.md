# How to contribute

This repository includes **samples**, **documentation** and **supporting scripts**. The core source code for the SDK is not part of this repository.

Contributions to the sample project, documentation, or supporting scripts are welcome, and if applicable, approved changes will be included in the next release of the SDK package. 

Please refer to the following sections on what is expected of feature requests, bug reports, and code contributions.

## Submitting feature requests
For feature requests and suggestions, please log a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/MapsSDK-Unity/issues). 

When creating a feature request or suggestion, please provide a clear description and any Unity version requirements or other relevant dependencies.

## Filing bugs
For non-security related bugs please log a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/MapsSDK-Unity/issues). 

When submitting a bug, please be sure to include a clear and concise description of the issue, Unity version, steps to reproduce, and any other relevant information like stack traces or screenshots.

## Reporting security issues
Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security
Response Center (MSRC) at [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com). You should
receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via
email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the
[MSRC PGP](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dn606155) key, can be found in

## Contributing code and content


### Identifying the scale

If you would like to contribute a small bug fix to the supporting scripts, a documentation improvement, or contribution to the sample projects, feel free to start working on the change and to submit a pull request at any time.

If you would like to contribute a significant bug fix or new feature to the supporting scripts, please discuss the change with the team by starting a discussion on the issues page.
Pull requests are welcome and encouraged for the supporting scripts, but these changes must meet a high bar since the scripts are distributed as part of the SDK package.

### Submitting a pull request

Once a change is ready, submit a pull request to the master branch. 

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

### Feedback

Your pull request will go through review by the team. We will attempt to review changes as soon as possible. 

### Publishing

For changes to the supporting scripts, once a pull request has been approved and merged to master, we will schedule it for release in the next SDK package update. We will provide an ETA on the SDK package release.

Changes to documentation and samples don't need to be published to the SDK package, so once a pull request is complete, the changes will be immediately reflected in the master branch.
